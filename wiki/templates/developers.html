<h1>Developers</h1>
<p>The code for Propolis Wiki is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/pharesim/propolis-wiki">GitHub</a></p>
<p>The application uses python and Flask, with a few javascript libraries thrown in for the editor and the diffs.</p>
<p>Especially for the editor, help would be welcome. Contact @pharesim on Discord if you're interested in fixing a couple of bugs.</p>
<p>So far the project has not had any design work done, if you're fluent with CSS and can maybe even combine it with vanilla JS you'd be greeted like a unicorn.</p>
<p>Code is messy, but try to not make it worse. There are some standards.</p>
